### What is Programming?
**Programming** is the process of writing, testing, and maintaining a program to solve a specific problem.  

### What is a Programming Language?
A **programming language** is a formal language used to communicate with computers.  

### Types of Programming Languages
There are three types of programming languages:  

1. **Low-Level Languages** üè© ‚Äì These languages are machine-friendly and can directly interact with hardware.  
   **Examples:** Binary Language, Assembly Language  

2. **Mid-Level Languages** ‚öñÔ∏è ‚Äì These languages are both machine-friendly and user-friendly.  
   **Examples:** C, C++  

3. **High-Level Languages** üöÄ ‚Äì These languages are user-friendly and easy to read and write.  
   **Examples:** Python, Java, JavaScript

### What is compiler?
A **compiler** is a software that translates the high level language to low level language.

### What is interpreter?
A **interpreter** is a software that translates the high level language to low level language.

### what is the difference between compiler and interpreter? 
| Feature | Compiler | Interpreter |  
|---------|---------|------------|  
| **Execution** | Translates the entire code at once and then runs | Translates and runs code line by line |  
| **Speed** | Faster (since the whole code is translated once) | Slower (since it translates line by line) |  
| **Error Handling** | Shows all errors at once | Stops at the first error and reports it immediately |  
| **Examples** | C, C++ (compiled languages) | Python, JavaScript (interpreted languages) |
